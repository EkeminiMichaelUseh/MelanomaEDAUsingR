                        Because human skin is exposed to this dangerous 
                        beam daily, further research is important.

                    Denmark, between 1962 and 1977. The data collected 
                    were survival time, patient’s status, sex, age, year 
                    of surgery, thickness of tumor,

                    <p><span class="steps">Time</span><br>
                        Based on the time summary statistics, 
                        the minimum number of days survived 
                        since the procedure is 10. The most days 
                        that have passed after the procedure is 5565. 
                        First quartile equals 1525 days. 3042 days is 
                        the third quartile. 2005 days is the median. 
                        Average (days survived on average) = 2152.8, or 
                        2153 days. There is an anomaly in the time variable, 
                        as seen by the box plot. The histogram shows this to 
                        be equally true. This anomaly is most likely the largest 
                        value of time that has previously been recorded in the time 
                        summary data, which is 5565 days. With modes at roughly 750 
                        days, 1750 days, and 3250 days, the histogram is multimodal. 
                        A normal distribution does not exist.

                    <p><span class="steps">Status</span><br>
                        The status variable has a factor type and is 
                        categorical. As a result, the total observations 
                        for each category make up the summary. 
                        There have been 57 deaths worldwide due to melanoma. 
                        There are 134 people still living. There have been fourteen 
                        deaths overall from causes unrelated to their melanoma.
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="steps">Sex</span><br>
                        The data type for this variable is "factor", 
                        making it categorical. The total for each category 
                        is thus the summary statistics. 126 females and 79 males
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="steps">Age</span><br>
                        An outlier has been identified in the age summary 
                        statistics, with a minimum value of 4 years. 
                        The average age is almost 56 years old. 
                        Minimum age = 4 years, according to the age summary 
                        statistics. 95 years old is the maximum age. 
                        42 years is the first quartile. Third Quartile: 65 years old. The patient's middle age, or median age, 
                        is 54 years old. 52 years is the average (mean).
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="steps">Year</span><br>
                        According to this record, the greatest 
                        number of melanoma surgery (41 total) were 
                        performed in 1972. There were no records of 
                        melanoma surgeries in 1963, 1975, or 1976.
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="steps">Thickness</span><br>
                        Outliers are present in the data on tumor 
                        thickness. The smallest tumor thickness 
                        (Minimum thickness) = 0.10 mm. 
                        1st Quartile = 0.97 mm. 3rd Quartile = 3.56 mm. 
                        Median (Middle thickness) = 1.94 mm. Average tumor 
                        thickness (Mean) = 2.92 mm. The presence of outliers 
                        makes the maximum thickness 17.42 mm. Using a boxplot, 
                        the maximum is seen to be approximately 7.50 mm. 
                        The variance of tumor thickness = 8.758242. 
                        The standard deviation of thickness = 2.959433
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="steps">Ulcer</span><br>
                        out of the total patients operated on (205), 
                        those with ulcerations absent were more in number 
                        than those with ulcerations. Ulcer is a categorical 
                        variable with 'factor' as the data type. Therefore, 
                        each category's total number of observations is computed as summary statistics. 
                        Tumor ulcerations absent = 115, Tumor ulcerations present = 90
